# API

To run the API follow these steps

## Copy ENV

In the `env/` there is a file called `.env.example`. Copy the contents of this file and paste into a new file called `.env.local`. This is required to run the API.

## Install Dependencies

There is a convince command, `yarn install-dependencies` that will go and install `node_modules` where it's necessary. You can of course do this manually.

## Run the app

From the root, run `yarn start` to start the simulated API Gateway.
