# Suggestions

The only suggestion I have is to re-visit the rule about not using component frameworks.

I understand this is a new rule, to showcase skills. It is very tedious and time consuming to craft UI components. I think it's unrealistic to do this challenge in < 4 hours when you have to code all of the UI elements from scratch.

I don't think this would be an issue if style was not part of the grading process. If style was irrelevant, and all that mattered was functionality, sure. That is not the case, resulting in spending far too much time just tweaking CSS that has been mastered by these frameworks.

My alternative suggestion to this is perhaps allow component libraries, but not frameworks such as MUI. Another idea is to have bootcamp grads follow this, but allow candidates with some experience to use a framework. It took me far longer to do the styles than the functionality. Yet another idea is to make the challenge functionally more difficult in favor of dropping some of the style requirements. I personally would much rather spend time cranking away at a hard problem than aligning a box.

If that is the priority of the company, then I look rather foolish suggesting to drop it. However, this is the only piece of feedback I have.

## General Feedback

- Wide range of skills required to complete, which is cool.
- Interesting requirements which keeps it fresh.
